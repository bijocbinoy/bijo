        <div class="about1">
            <p>Hello! I'm Bijo C Binoy, a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications specializing in Big Data Analytics and Cloud Computing from Yenepoya University, class of 2024. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in technology, and my hands-on experiences have honed my skills in various domains.</p>

          <p>  During my time at Yenepoya University, I was not only an active student but also deeply involved in extracurricular activities. I served as the secretary of the IT Club, where I organized several programs, including gaming events and basic web development workshops for fellow students. Additionally, I was appointed as the president of the YENOVA Club, where I played a key role in organizing the IBM ICE Day, featuring a 24-hour hackathon and other exciting events.</p>
            
           <p> I also completed an internship in Python development at Inmakes Infotech in Kochi, India. This experience allowed me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios, further enhancing my skills in web development using Flask and Django, as well as data analytics and machine learning.</p>
            
           <p> My leadership roles in college, including my membership in the student council, have taught me valuable lessons in collaboration and guidance. I believe in giving people the freedom to work independently and providing constructive feedback to help them grow.</p>
            
            <p>Outside of my professional life, I have a keen interest in agriculture and animal husbandry. Engaging in agriculture and caring for animals has taught me patience, responsibility, and the importance of sustainable practices.     I am driven by a commitment to excellence and a passion for innovation. Looking ahead, I am excited about the opportunities to contribute to impactful projects and collaborate with like-minded professionals in the tech industry.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Please feel free to explore my work and reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate.</p>
